# About

* A simple paint-like Flask app.

* This app allows you to draw on the canvas, without any background. You only have to worry about which area to color.

* You can download the image once you finish or completely discard it by clicking new.

* You can erase a particular point in the canvas, the deleted portion will be transparent.
